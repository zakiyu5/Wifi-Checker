program to show available networks 
here we need to import a module named as subprocess 
then after we create two python objects one with networks and another 
one decoded for the ASCII
program
import subprocess
nw = subprocess.checkoutput(["netsh","wlan","show","networks"])
decorded_nw = nw.decord("ASCII")
print(decorded_nw)<|eom_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant
print(decorded_nw)# printing available networks
